Recipe: Waffles of Insane Greatness

This recipe (originally from Aretha Frankenstein's restaurant in Chattanooga,
TN) is the ideal I-just-woke-up-from-a-waffle-dream waffle, a morning-of
alternative to the overnight yeasted kind. The cornstarch in the batter helps
tamp down gluten formation, making these waffles silky and moist inside with a
crust as thin and crisp as an eggshell.

Ingredients

3/4 cup flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1/3 cup melted butter
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract


Instructions

Combine wet ingredients in a separate bowl
Gently mix wet ingredients into dry ingredients. Do not overmix.
Let batter rest for 30 minutes
