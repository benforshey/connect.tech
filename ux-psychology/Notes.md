# The Psychology of User Testing

User / Usability Testing is the process of figuring out what your users want and how they use your product. You can distinguish between user and usability testing, but the psychology stays the same.

## Moderated

Watch users use your product. You can have a conversation: "What do you think about this?" "Talk me through what you're doing." You can mislead your users to put them at ease. "I'm gonna catch up on some emails while you do these user flows."

## Remote Moderated

You're not in the room, but you're still watching users use your product. Can use Hangouts, for instance.

## Remote Un-Moderated

You are not in the room, but you're capturing data, like heatmapping.

## Steps to Testing

1. form a hypothesis
2. design a study
3. collect data
4. analyze results
5. share findings
6. iterate

## Cognitive Biases

The difference between what you perceive and what you interpret. Do you best to ask "flat" questions, to try and overcome people's inherent biases. Try to overcome biases, because you want to test your product's variables, not user variables. Try to get a diverse sample of your user base. Use different moderators. Practice for consistency (take the test yourself).

* inattention biases & confirmation biases
* Hawthorne/Observer Effect
  * people change their behaviors when they know they are being watched
  * To overcome: create a judgement-free zone and stay out of direct sight (track remotely?)
* Ordering Effect
  * the order than you present information to your users can bias / fatigue them
  * To overcome: change the order or A/B test
* Social Desirability Effect
  * we want to give an answer favorable to the person asking it (be likable)
  * Leading: "How _easy_ was it to find that information?"; "How _difficult_ was it to find that information?"
  * Better: "What would you expect to happen if you clicked this button?"; "Tell me more about that."
  * To overcome: avoid leading questions, prevent one-word responses, be aware of non-verbal communication
