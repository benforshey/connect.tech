# Patterns that Demystify Great UX/UI

## UX vs UI

Kind of a left-brain / right-brain thing. Analytical thinking vs creative thinking.

## UX and UI

Work together.

### Foundational UI

* Stylized Branding
* Common Patters

### Foundational UX

* user needs
* workflows & processes
* minimum UX balances user and business goals
  * this generates user tasks
  * which generates user flow diagrams
* mobile is not optional

## Listen More

* seek answers to the h0w5 (how, who, what, where, when, why)
  * also, you can ask "Why?" 5 times to get the deepest answer

## Target Users

* 3-7 participants
* 3–5 tasks
* 30–45 minutes

## Consider Each State

* new user
* empty
* success
* error

## Don't Make Users Wait

* also, anything that takes more than 1s needs a progress indicator
* a spinning loading indicator helps users hold on to 14 seconds
* a custom loading indicator helps users hold on up to 22 seconds
* better yet, tell the user what is going on behind the scenes
* or even better yet, don't make the user wait
